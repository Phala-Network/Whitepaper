\section{Introduction}

Nowadays the security of the permissionless blockchain is typically guaranteed by state replication over consensus algorithms. Though this approach works well for blockchain, it also means everything on the blockchain is public, which brings a problem: confidential information cannot be handled by the blockchain.
\zhou{We need some real-world cases under which confidentiality is vital.}
\hang{todo: processing business data on-chain, DeFi position privacy, GDRP complaince...}

Several projects addressed the privacy problem. Monero and Zcash implemented private transaction by ring signature~\cite{monero} and zk-SNARK~\cite{zcash} technology but it's limited to cryptocurrencies and hard to be extended to general-purpose smart contracts. MPC (multi-party computing) can theoretically run arbitrary programs without revealing intermediate state to the participants but also introduces a performance overhead of $10^6$ times~\cite{cheng2019ekiden}.

Currently, pure software solutions are not viable. A new approach is to utilize special hardware. TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)~\cite{teewiki} is a special area in some processors that provides a higher level of security including isolated execution, code integration, and state confidentiality. Naive TEE as a computing platform has several shortages such as the lack of a reliable time source and availability guarantee.
\zhou{There should be more shortage examples.}
\hang{Added: reliable time source.}

Ekiden~\cite{cheng2019ekiden} fixed these problems by introducing a TEE-blockchain hybrid architecture and implemented high performance confidential smart contract. However, contracts in Ekiden are isolated, meaning the contracts cannot interoperate with each other, and cannot interoperate with external blockchains.

In this paper, we present Phala Network, a novel cross-chain interoperable confidential smart contract network as a Polkadot parachain. We introduce an \textit{Event Sourcing / Command Query Responsibility Segregation}~\cite{eventsourcing, cqrs} architecture into a TEE-blockchain hybrid system to achieve cross-chain interoperability for confidential smart contracts. We further designed a Libra-Polkadot bridge to implement a privacy-preserving Libra Coin by confidential contract.
